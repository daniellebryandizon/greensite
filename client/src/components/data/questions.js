        question: 'What Are Microgreens?',
        answer: 'Microgreens are tiny edible plants that are older than a sprout, but younger than a full-grown plant. Microgreens are harvested after the first “true” leaves have developed. They are the smallest of the salad greens, and can be grown from almost any plant variety that would produce a mature plant, such as beet, radish or mustard.'

        question: 'How It Works?',
        answer: 'We provide valuable varieties of microgreens, grown and harvested to-order. Choose to sample any of our varieties and within 2 weeks we can deliver a custom order to your restaurant/store. We believe that freshness is flavour so you can choose to have our microgreens delivered alive, in growing trays, to you. This preserves their delicious flavour and crisp texture. If you are looking for something we don’t currently offer, just let us know. We are always experimenting with unique varieties and love the challenge of growing something new.'

        question: 'What’s The Difference Between Sprouts And Microgreens?',
        answer: 'Because of their size, microgreens are often confused with sprouts. They are not sprouts. Sprouts are just germinated seeds grown in water that are eaten whole, with the seed, root and stem still attached. . Microgreens are not grown in water, as are sprouts. They are commonly grown in soil or on a sterile growing mat such as a fiber mat. The seed density for microgreens is much lower than for sprouts, which allows plenty of room for each tiny plant to grow, and prevents the disease problems common to sprouts. Microgreens are harvested by cutting, without any roots.'

        question: 'What Are The Best Plants To Grow As Microgreens?',
        answer: 'Because microgreens are widely used to add “zing” to a main course or salad, the most popular varieties are the spicy ones. These include arugula, which adds a spicy, peppery flavor to other foods, basil, celery, cabbage, cilantro, a widely used spicy herb, endive, mustard and tangy radish. In addition to the popular spicy microgreens, growers will also produce a wide range of colorful greens, such as rainbow chard or kale.'

        question: 'When Should Microgreens Be Harvested?',
        answer: 'Most microgreens are ready to harvest when they have produced a second set of leaves, known as “true leaves.” Some growers also let the microgreens continue to grow an additional week or so to produce baby greens, also a popular and profitable sideline crop to sell to buyers.'

        question: 'Do Microgreens Have Special Nutritional Value?',
        answer: 'Studies have shown many microgreens, such as red cabbage, broccoli, and radish often contain up to 40 times more nutrients that mature plants. According to Professor Qin Wang at the University of Maryland, microgreens are 4 to 40 fold more concentrated with nutrients. His research team tested 25 different commercially grown microgreens, and found consistently high levels of important nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin K, lutein and beta-carotene. Dr Gene Lester, a USDA researcher says, “All these nutrients are extremely important for skin, eyes and fighting cancer, and have all sorts of benefits associated with them. To find these high levels of nutrients, I find that quite astonishing.”'

        question: 'Are Special Seeds Required For Microgreens?',
        answer: 'The seeds used for microgreens are untreated seeds, preferably organic, that are the same seeds used to grow full-size plants. As the plants are grown much closer together, it takes more seed to grow microgreens than field-grown crops. '

Consider adding a punch of flavor and nutrition to your weeknight salads with a sharper microgreen like cabbage or daikon radish',
